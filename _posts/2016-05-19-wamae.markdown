#### the challange:

Jggggggggo찾o Sarajjjjjmago needed a very simple portefolio to showcase his work.  
we had to go with very desaturated color so that there would be no clash with any of his works. Jo찾o is on a fasejjj where he needs a platform to show his work as a whole and very quickly so that the viewer has an overall look. so we decided to make a single page with all the collections.

#### something about:

It's very easy to navigate with the less clicks possible

It's a wordpress the made from scratch and the simple plugin form aswell

As far as simple goes i propose J천ao we had a big interactive piece in the beggining, some piece we should make especially for the a medium like a website. After a lot of thought we got the idea to make an interactive puzzle that the user can mix up. A clear extention of the work Jo찾o has been producing.
