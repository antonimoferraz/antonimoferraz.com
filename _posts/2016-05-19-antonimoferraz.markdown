#### the challenge:

Having myself as a client is the worst. I put every guideline and every decision in question. it's easier to compromise with other people more then with myself. So making this website took too much time.
Being a freelancer not only in web development but in graphics design as well i has a real challenge to make a website that would be relevant for tech savvy people (companies for example) and for the everyday person that needs a service in websites or graphics design.

#### look and feel:

I wanted a very simple navigation and things had to be very easy to find.

I also wanted a big emphasis on illustration. not only for the look and feel but also to showcase SVG for the tech side and shapes for the graphics side.


#### opportunities:

Had to come out of my comfort zone.
well this was a good opportunity to make myself better at technologies i wasn't proficient. so thanks to this i'm good in Liquid, Jekyll and git.
